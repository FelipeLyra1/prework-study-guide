## Description

This project is the first opportunity for me to commnece a new journey in life for me that was missing. I didn't know what i was going to do, all I knew was that I wanted something that was woth my effort and time where I could see results of my fruition. Then I found this Course and without an explanation a "switch" flipped in my mind, "I want to do Programming and I know this is the opportunity that I need". All of this set my mind straight to why I needed to build this project, to show my self that I am commited. It wasn't with it's ups and downs tho, I did ended up almost breaking the entire Main branch by entering the wrong command in bash, thankfully the version recovery exists as I had to redo all Java lessons to fix the code massive code break that I don't know it was generated. I did not expect to learn this much code in this fast as a panic indussing rush to realize my code was not like what it needed to be in chapter 3.4.6. It was so satifying to get the "Aha!" moments and see you effort be worth what you put in. 10 out of 10 would recomend.
